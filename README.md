## Overview

This application allows the user to lookup an ip address or domain and get information about the location, timezone, and isp for the inputed domain/ip. This project uses and API from [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) to get information on an ip address/domain. This application also uses [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create a simple, but very effectiive map to show the user the location of the inputed domain/ip.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### What I learned

This was my first project using API's and I really enjoyed using them because of ES8 async/await with js is very useful and good in terms of readability. I learned about Promises and how they can not only be used with just API, but also any process that runs asynchronously with your application.
